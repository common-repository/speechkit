== Changelog ==

**This is a list detailing changes for past BeyondWords releases. For more information about the current release, see readme.txt.**

= 4.7.0 =

Release date: 2nd May 2024

**Fixes**

* [#388](https://github.com/beyondwords-io/wordpress-plugin/pull/388) If the post body [has_blocks](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/has_blocks/) then remove the `wpautop` filter before sending it to our REST API. This filter was stripping closing `</p>` tags from empty paragraph blocks.

**Enhancements**

* [#386](https://github.com/beyondwords-io/wordpress-plugin/pull/386) Prepend custom plugin links instead of appending them
* [#384](https://github.com/beyondwords-io/wordpress-plugin/pull/384) Refactoring to improve code quality
* [#388](https://github.com/beyondwords-io/wordpress-plugin/pull/388) Unit tests for empty paragraphs
* Prevent empty `data-beyondwords-marker` attributes

= 4.6.2 =

Release date: 11th April 2024

**Enhancements**

* Tested up to WordPress 6.5.
* PHPUnit code coverage badge and report.

= 4.6.1 =

Release date: 28th March 2024

**Fixes**

* [#378](https://github.com/beyondwords-io/wordpress-plugin/pull/378) Only auto-prepend player for [is_singular](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/is_singular/) queries.

**Enhancements**

* [#373](https://github.com/beyondwords-io/wordpress-plugin/pull/373) Run [Plugin Check (PCP)](https://wordpress.org/plugins/plugin-check/) in our GitHub Actions workflow to check we meet the WordPress.org plugin directory coding standards.
    * Includes various minor code updates to resolve the reported errors and warnings.

= 4.6.0 =

Release date: 28th March 2024

**Enhancements**

* To support BeyondWords’ upcoming summarization product, the BeyondWords REST API now expects the post excerpt to be prepended to the body for API requests.
    * If you have enabled "Use excerpts for summaries" in the plugin settings we will now automatically combine the fields. You should not see a difference, or need to make any changes.
    * If you are currently passing a `summary` field to us using another method (e.g. our [beyondwords_content_params](https://docs.beyondwords.io/docs-and-guides/content/connect-cms/wordpress/wordpress-filters/beyondwords_content_params) filter) then we should have provided advance notice of this change to you. If this change affects you, and you didn’t hear from us in advance, then please contact [support@beyondwords.io](mailto:support@beyondwords.io).

= 4.5.1 =

Release date: 14th March 2024

**Enhancements**

* Make the BeyondWords column in WP admin sortable.

**Fixes**

* We now only render plugin components on the Post edit screens if the REST API credentials have been validated.
* Improved handling for REST API calls that fail while editing posts. This fixes the following issues:
    * The block editor crashed if the API Key and/or Project ID had not been entered in the plugin settings.
    * The block editor crashed if REST API calls failed for other reasons e.g. network problems.
* Removed a console log intended for debugging.

= 4.5.0 =

Release date: 1st March 2024

**Enhancements**

* Audio content for posts created with a future publish date is now available to preview in the WordPress admin players. To achieve this we handle a `preview_token` returned from the BeyondWords REST API.
* In Site Health and throughout the code, replace "Allowed post types" and "Supported post types" with "Compatible post types" and "Incompatible post types" to improve clarity.

**Code Refactoring**

* A general tidy-up of all code and docs for the public open-source release of our plugin repo at https://github.com/beyondwords-io/wordpress-plugin.
* Remove `BEYONDWORDS_DEBUG` constant throughout the code - this was only ever used internally for the legacy player, so it has been removed for the public repo release.
* Prevent side-effects in PHP constructors.

= 4.4.0 =

Release date: 11th January 2024

**Enhancements**

* Tested up to WordPress 6.4.
* Tested up to PHP 8.3.
* Delete audio when *Remove* feature is used. When you *Remove* audio using the Inspect panel we now make a DELETE request to the BeyondWords API to keep WordPress and the BeyondWords dashboard in sync.
* Add BeyondWords version and WordPress version into copied Inspect Panel data.

**Fixes**

* Use optional chaining before accessing properties. This fixes an undefined error when the sidebar is loaded. The issue was reported by Cypress testing in our CI pipeline.

= 4.3.0 =

Release date: 7th December 2023

**Deprecations**

We have renamed and removed some of our WordPress filters to make them simpler to understand and to implement.

The deprecated filters listed below are scheduled to be removed from the code in plugin v5.0, so please migrate to any replacements as soon as possible.

* Filters we have simply renamed (the functionality remains exactly the same):
    * `beyondwords_body_params`: Renamed to `beyondwords_content_params`
    * `beyondwords_player_styles`: Renamed to `beyondwords_settings_player_styles`
    * `beyondwords_post_types`: Renamed to `beyondwords_settings_post_types`
    * `beyondwords_post_statuses`: Renamed to `beyondwords_settings_post_statuses`
* Filters we have removed because there are suitable alternatives:
    * `beyondwords_amp_player_html`: Instead, use the `beyondwords_player_html` filter which is now applied to the player HTML for AMP and non-AMP content.
    * `beyondwords_content`: Instead, set the `body` key in the `beyondwords_content_params` filter
    * `beyondwords_post_metadata`: Instead, set the `metadata` key in the `beyondwords_content_params` filter
    * `beyondwords_post_audio_enabled_blocks`: Instead, refer to our [Filter content](https://docs.beyondwords.io/docs-and-guides/content/filter-content) docs for an alternative.
    * `beyondwords_post_player_enabled`: Instead, return an empty string in the `beyondwords_player_html` filter to hide the player. Alternatively, you can set `published` to `false` in the BeyondWords dashboard.
* Filters we have deprecated because the functionality is no longer required:
    * `beyondwords_js_player_params`: This only applies to the Legacy player which will be removed in plugin v5.0
    * `beyondwords_content_id`: We believe this is not being used, please contact [support@beyondwords.io](mailto:support@beyondwords.io) if you are using this filter.
    * `beyondwords_project_id`: We believe this is not being used, please contact [support@beyondwords.io](mailto:support@beyondwords.io) if you are using this filter.

We have also renamed `PostContentUtils::getBodyJson` to `PostContentUtils::getContentParams`, to match the `beyondwords_content_params` filter name.

= 4.2.4 =

Release date: 15th November 2023

**Fixes**

* Ensure the `$content` param of `Beyondwords\Wordpress\Core\Player\Player::hasCustomPlayer` is a string before using `strpos`.

= 4.2.3 =

Release date: 2nd November 2023

**Fixes**

* Pass full-size (originally uploaded) featured image to the BeyondWords API instead of a cropped thumbnail. The 240x240 thumbnail we replaced was not suitable for some styles of the latest player.

= 4.2.2 =

Release date: 27th October 2023

**Fixes**

* Ensure segment markers are added to the HTML body before we pass it to our REST API. This fixes an issue where "Playback from paragraph" was not working in some cases.
* Update the block control restrictions. This is to fix an issue where the block controls – including the "Audio processing enabled/diabled" toggle – sometimes did not appear when a block was clicked.

= 4.2.1 =

Release date: 12th October 2023

**Enhancements**

* Prevent player analytics events from being recorded in WordPress admin by setting the `{ analyticsConsent: 'none' }` param for admin players.

= 4.2.0 =

Release date: 10th October 2023

**Enhancements**

* Add `[beyondwords_player]` shortcode. See our "WordPress shortcode" docs at [https://docs.beyondwords.io/docs-and-guides/content/connect-cms/wordpress].

**Fixes**

* Ensure an array is always returned for `PlayerStyle::getCachedPlayerStyles()` to prevent PHP warnings.
* For AMP content, the player is no longer auto-prepended if a custom player is found in the content.
* Clean up 'beyondwords_player_style' option on plugin uninstall.

= 4.1.2 =

Release date: 21st September 2023

**Enhancements**

* Added "Large" option into "Player style" plugin setting.

= 4.1.1 =

Release date: 15th September 2023

**Enhancements**

* Tested up to WordPress 6.3.

= 4.1.0 =

Release date: 15th September 2023

**Enhancements**

* "Player style" support.
    * A "Player style" setting has been added to the plugin settings screen where you can assign the default player style for your audio players.
    * The default style can be overridden for each post on the post edit screen.
    * A `beyondwords_player_styles` filter is available so you can modify the options of the "Player style" select boxes in WordPress admin.
    * We are currently beta testing a video. To discuss enabling this for your project please contact [support@beyondwords.io](mailto:support@beyondwords.io).
    * For more information on the supported styles see `playerStyle` at [https://github.com/beyondwords-io/player/blob/main/doc/player-settings.md].
* "Delete audio" option added into "Bulk actions".

**Fixes**

* Fixed the "Remove" button for the Inspect panel in Classic Editor.
* BeyondWords errors now show in the Classic Editor metabox.
* The "Language" and "Voice" selectors now show in the Classic Editor metabox.

= 4.0.6 =

Release date: 7th September 2023

**Fixes**

* Always call `setAttributes` for `beyondwordsMarker` in the `editor.BlockEdit` filter. Previously this was only being called when the BeyondWords sidebar panel was open.
* Remove the unwanted `blocks.getSaveContent.props` filter. This was doing nothing because the filter name was incorrect (it was a typo for `blocks.getSaveContent.extraProps` which we don't need).

= 4.0.5 =

Release date: 24th August 2023

**Fixes**

* Fix reported PHP Warnings by checking that [get_current_screen](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_current_screen/) return value is truthy.

= 4.0.4 =

Release date: 17th August 2023

**Fixes**

* Fix an intermittent issue where segment markers are not always assigned to blocks. Our `blocks.registerBlockType` filter now matches [the example in the official WordPress docs](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/filters/block-filters/#blocks-registerblocktype).
* Hide the audio player widget (the player docked to the bottom of the screen when you scroll) in WordPress admin screens.

= 4.0.3 =

Release date: 4th August 2023

**Fixes**

* Cast the return value of [get_the_post_thumbnail_url](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_the_post_thumbnail_url/) to string before sending to the BeyondWords API. This fixes an issue where we were sending boolean `false` as the `image_url` field for posts without a featured image.

= 4.0.2 =

Release date: 3rd August 2023

**Fixes**

* Prefix `/languages` and `/voices` endpoints with `/organization` to reflect recent changes in API. This fixes the issue where no languages or voices could be found.

= 4.0.1 =

Release date: 30th July 2023

**Fixes**

* Set minimum supported versions to PHP 7.4 and WordPress 5.8.
* Fix issue where the audio player was disappearing in Classic Editor when the Player UI setting was "Headless" or "Disabled".
* Remove unwanted console logs.

= 4.0.0 =

Release date: 26th July 2023

**Fixes**

* Fixed broken "Copy" button in Block editor Inspect panel.

**Improvements**

* API calls are now made to the new BeyondWords REST API at [api.beyondwords.io](https://api.beyondwords.io).
* Custom languages and voices for your audio. [Docs here](https://docs.beyondwords.io/docs-and-guides/content/connect-cms/wordpress/add-languages?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=&utm_content=plugin).
* Our advanced "Latest" audio player is available. [Docs here](https://docs.beyondwords.io/docs-and-guides/content/connect-cms/wordpress/updating-to-the-latest-player?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=&utm_content=plugin).
* Using "Headless mode" you can take advantage of audio processing and the audio CMS whilst building their own front-end players. [Docs here](https://docs.beyondwords.io/docs-and-guides/content/connect-cms/wordpress/headless-mode?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=&utm_content=plugin).
* The following new filters have been added.
    * [beyondwords_body_params](https://docs.beyondwords.io/docs-and-guides/content/connect-cms/wordpress/wordpress-filters/beyondwords_body_params?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=&utm_content=plugin).
    * [beyondwords_content_id](https://docs.beyondwords.io/docs-and-guides/content/connect-cms/wordpress/wordpress-filters/beyondwords_content_id?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=&utm_content=plugin)
    * [beyondwords_player_script_onload](https://docs.beyondwords.io/docs-and-guides/content/connect-cms/wordpress/wordpress-filters/beyondwords_player_script_onload?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=&utm_content=plugin)
    * [beyondwords_player_sdk_params](https://docs.beyondwords.io/docs-and-guides/content/connect-cms/wordpress/wordpress-filters/beyondwords_player_sdk_params?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=&utm_content=plugin)
    * [beyondwords_post_audio_enabled_blocks](https://docs.beyondwords.io/docs-and-guides/content/connect-cms/wordpress/wordpress-filters/beyondwords_post_audio_enabled_blocks?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=&utm_content=plugin)
    * [beyondwords_project_id](https://docs.beyondwords.io/docs-and-guides/content/connect-cms/wordpress/wordpress-filters/beyondwords_project_id?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=&utm_content=plugin)

**Breaking changes**

* `beyondwords_podcast_id` is now stored and retrieved as `beyondwords_content_id`.
    * This should not affect most websites, but if your site has custom PHP that uses the `beyondwords_podcast_id` custom field then you need to update your code to prefer `beyondwords_content_id`.
    * Existing `beyondwords_podcast_id` post metadata will be updated to `beyondwords_content_id` automatically as each post is queried in WordPress requests.
* For WpGraphQL, `beyondwords.podcastId` was defined as type: `Int`. We have changed the type to `String` to support the new ID format (UUID). Your code may need to be updated to handle this change.
* Removed built-in WPML support (our compatibility unfortunately failed over time). Support for translation plugins can now be achieved using the following WordPress hooks:
    * `beyondwords_body_params`
    * `beyondwords_project_id`
* Some older deprecated filters have been removed:
    * `speechkit_post_types`: Migrate to `beyondwords_post_types`
    * `speechkit_post_statuses`: Migrate to `beyondwords_post_statuses`
    * `sk_player_before`: Migrate to beyondwords_js_player_html / beyondwords_amp_player_html
    * `sk_the_content`: Migrate to `beyondwords_js_player_html` / `beyondwords_amp_player_html`
    * `sk_player_after` Migrate to `beyondwords_js_player_html` / `beyondwords_amp_player_html`
    * `speechkit_js_player_html` Migrate to `beyondwords_js_player_html`
    * `speechkit_amp_player_html` Migrate to `beyondwords_amp_player_html`
    * `speechkit_post_player_enabled` Migrate to `beyondwords_post_player_enabled`

    * We’ve added a “BeyondWords” tab into the Elementor [Page Settings Panel](https://developers.elementor.com/docs/editor/page-settings-panel/).
    * Use the controls in this tab to generate audio, toggle player visibility, and preview audio.
    * If you experience any Elementor compatibility issues after this update please email [support@beyondwords.io](mailto:support@beyondwords.io).

= 3.9.2 =

Release date: 20th October 2022

**Fixes**

* "Setup guide" URL has been updated because it was 404ing.
* Removed type checking for the `$postId` param in `PostContentUtils::createHash()`, to fix a reported PHP error for WooCommerce sites.

= 3.9.1 =

Release date: 6th October 2022

**Compatible with WordPress 5.8 or greater**

* [WordPress core dropped support for IE in version 5.8](https://wordpress.org/news/2021/05/dropping-support-for-internet-explorer-11/) released July 2021.
* The official [wp-scripts](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-scripts/) package we use does not produce IE-friendly code, so we have adjusted our minimum supported WordPress version to 5.8.

**Enhancements**

* Hide audio controls for blocks if the post does not have audio.
* Partial source code linting (using `wp-scripts lint-js --fix`).

= 3.9.0 =

Release date: 22nd September 2022

**Enhancements**

* Added a "Remove" button into the Inspect panel to clear BeyondWords data for individual posts.
* Delete audio data in BeyondWords API when a post is trashed or deleted in WordPress. Restoring the post in WordPress will restore the audio data in BeyondWords.

**Fixes**

* Add the missing `beyondwordsAudio` block attribute for server-rendered blocks. Thanks for the report and fix, @hughiemolloy! 🙌
* Don't register the `_speechkit_disable_generate_audio` custom field. This plugin v2.x field has not been used in a while, so there is no need to register it.

**Continuous Integration**

* The Docker config for local development now closely matches our CI config – they now both use [WP CLI](https://wp-cli.org/) to download and install WordPress.
* Improvements to our [CodeCeption](https://codeception.com/) test suites to fix an intermittent MySQL error.

= 3.8.1 =

Release date: 25th August 2022

**Enhancements**

* Enable/disable audio processing for each block when using the Gutenberg editor. Disabled blocks will not be processed as audio.

**Code Refactoring**

* Refactor the `Core\PostUtils` class into `Core\PostContentUtils` and `Core\PostMetaUtils` to reduce class complexity.

= 3.8.0 =

Release date: 25th August 2022

**Enhancements**

* Enable/disable audio processing for each block when using the Gutenberg editor. Disabled blocks will not be processed as audio.

**Code Refactoring**

* Refactor the `Core\PostUtils` class into `Core\PostContentUtils` and `Core\PostMetaUtils` to reduce class complexity.

= 3.7.1 =

Release date: 12th August 2022

**Fixes**

* Remove the "X BeyondWords errors" notice on the Posts screen to fix a reported slow MySQL query. We are working on a long-term fix for this problem. In the meantime, individual error messages are still available to view in the BeyondWords column (Posts screen) and BeyondWords panel (Post Edit screen).

= 3.7.0 =

Release date: 11th August 2022

**Important developer notice**

* In this update our plugin instance has been renamed from `$speechkit_wordpress_plugin` to `$beyondwords_wordpress_plugin`.
* Please do not access the plugin instance directly in your code. The objects and methods it contains are intended for internal use, and over time they are likely to change.
* Instead, use the [documented WordPress filters](https://docs.beyondwords.io/docs/integrations/wordpress/wordpress-filters) and contact our team via [hello@beyondwords.io](mailto:hello@beyondwords.io) if you need new actions or filters to achieve your goals.

**Enhancements**

* Automatically clear all `beyondwords_*` and `speechkit_*` data when the plugin is uninstalled.
* Add BeyondWords section to 'Tools' > 'Site Health'.
* 'Bulk actions' > 'Generate audio' now regenerates audio if it already exists (bulk processing previously "Skipped" posts which already had audio).
* Replace remaining instances of "SpeechKit" brand name with "BeyondWords".
    * There were still instances where the former brand name for BeyondWords was being used throughout the code - mostly in the names for custom fields and filters.
    * These have now all been updated, maintaining support for older posts with `speechkit_*` data.
* Improve "Pending review" support.
    * When a post is saved in WordPress we now send `{ published: true|false }` to the BeyondWords API.
    * This is primarily to prevent audio appearing in BeyondWords playlists for posts which are saved as "pending" in WordPress.

**Fixes**

* Add `isset()` checks for `$beyondwords_wordpress_plugin->player` to prevent PHP "Undefined property" errors.

= 3.6.1 =

Release date: 6th May 2022

**Fixes**

* When posts were saved using the WordPress Block Editor multiple BeyondWords API calls could be made. This resulted in the "Skipped" status for audio, and a fix for this has been added.
* Handle responses saved as object of class `WP_Error`. Older posts edited with v2.x of our plugin could have an unexpected `WP_Error` in a custom field. We now handle this, fixing a reported PHP error on the Post Edit screen.

= 3.6.0 =

Release date: 29th April 2022

**Enhancements**

* Expose BeyondWords data in GraphQL to support decoupled frontends. Post types which are supported by **both** BeyondWords and [WPGraphQL](https://www.wpgraphql.com/) have the following fields in GraphQL:
    * `beyondwords.podcastId`
    * `beyondwords.projectId`

**Code Coverage**

* Increased PHPUnit test coverage to 85%.

= 3.5.0 =

Release date: 20th April 2022

**Enhancements**

* WPML Compatibility. Read our [WordPress plugin](https://docs.beyondwords.io/docs/wordpress) docs for details.

**Fixes**

* Prevent CSS/JS assets loading on frontend pages where they are not needed.

**Code Refactoring**

* Refactor the `Core\Utils` class to improve PHPMD ExcessiveClassComplexity score.

= 3.4.0 =

Release date: 23rd March 2022

**Enhancements**

* We don't use the `external_id` feature of BeyondWords, so the param has been removed from the API calls.

**Fixes**

* The audio player now uses a socket connection while in Classic Editor.

= 3.3.3 =

Release date: 17th March 2022

**Fixes**

* Change initialisation method for the audio player in WordPress admin to prevent issues establishing the socket connection.

= 3.3.2 =

Release date: 10th March 2022

**Fixes**

Release date: 4th March 2022

**Fixes**

= 3.3.0 =

Release date: 23rd February 2022

**Enhancements**

* Send assigned taxonomies and terms to the BeyondWords API to aid custom playlist generation.

**Fixes**

= 3.2.0 =

Release date: 7th February 2022

**Fixes**

* By default, remove `pending` from the list of post statuses we generate audio for.

**Enhancements**

* Audio players can now be positioned anywhere in the post content! Use the **BeyondWords** block for the default Block Editor, or the TinyMCE "**Insert BeyondWords player**" button for Classic Editor.
* Provide `speechkit_post_types` filter to customise the post types we generate audio for. Post types without `custom-fields` in the `supports` array will be removed from this list.
* Provide `speechkit_post_statuses` filter to customise the post statuses we generate audio for.

= 3.1.0 =

Release date: 5th January 2022

**Deprecations**

* Deprecated 3 legacy filters: `sk_the_content`, `sk_player_before` and `sk_player_after`.
    * Replace these filters with `speechkit_js_player_html` and `speechkit_amp_player_html`.
    * Using the deprecated filters in v3.x will log a `_doing_it_wrong()` error.
    * In v4.0 the legacy filters will be removed.

**Fixes**

* Replace `WP_PLUGIN_DIR` and `WP_PLUGIN_URL` constants with `plugin_dir_path()` and `plugin_dir_url()` to improve multisite support.

**Enhancements**

* Improve AMP plugin compatibility by removing all potential problems reported in the AMP Validation Error Index.
* New `speechkit_amp_player_html` filter to modify the HTML for the AMP audio player.
* New `speechkit_js_player_html` filter to modify the HTML for the standard JavaScript audio player.

= 3.0.4 =

Release date: 22nd Nov 2021

**BeyondWords is the new name for SpeechKit.**

* All user-facing instances of `SpeechKit` have been replaced with `BeyondWords`.
* For a smooth transition, behind-the-scenes we have retained the following for the time being:
    * **Filters**, **custom fields** and **plugin options** are still prefixed as `speechkit_*`
    * DOM IDs and class names are still `speechkit-*`.
    * The plugin slug and text-domain are still `speechkit`
    * Requests to BeyondWords services are still made to speechkit.io domains.
* The complete transition to `beyondwords` and beyondwords.io domains will happen in the near future.
* We will always be backwards compatible with posts that were created with `speechkit_*` custom fields.

= 3.0.3 =

Release date: 18th Nov 2021

**Fixes**

* Run `speechkit_response` and `speechkit_error` custom fields through a new method to extract the HTTP response body.

Release date: 8th Nov 2021

**Features**

* We now use the latest SpeechKit API version.
* We now use the latest SpeechKit Player JavaScript SDK version.
* Audio can now be generated for multiple posts at once using Bulk Actions. Select your posts and then use 'Bulk Actions' > 'Generate audio'.
