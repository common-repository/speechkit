== ADVANCED TEXT-TO-SPEECH ==

Looking for the best text-to-speech plugin on WordPress?

Using methods like natural language processing (NLP), BeyondWords' unique text processing algorithms optimally convert your content into speech synthesis markup language (SSML). This enables AI voices to effectively pronounce elements that other platforms can struggle with, such as names, numbers, and dates, as well as filtering out elements that shouldn't be read aloud. You can even add aliases to ensure everything is read exactly how you want it.

BeyondWords gives you access to neural voices from Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft Azure (500+ voices across 140+ language locales).

You can also get access to premium neural voices &mdash; voice clones of professional voice actors that are exclusive to BeyondWords. Users have the option to develop a completely bespoke custom voice using our voice cloning service.

The result is naturalistic spoken-word audio content that engages your target audience &mdash; at a fraction of the cost of human recordings.

== EFFORTLESS DISTRIBUTION ==

BeyondWords makes it easy to reach new audiences and grow your listenership. As well as auto-embedding audio players to your WordPress site, you can embed your audio manually or share via URL. You can even download your audios as mp3 files.

This includes content created automatically with our WordPress text-to-speech plugin, as well as content created manually with the Text-to-Speech Editor &mdash; perfect for audio newsletters.

Users can even create custom playlists that keep listeners listening for longer. These can be embedded, shared via URL, or even distributed via podcast feed. That means you can reach audiences through platforms like Apple Podcasts and Spotify.

== ANALYTICS AND MONETIZATION ==

You get access to project analytics, which means you can track listener engagement at the project level through your BeyondWords dashboard. Users can also get access to audio analytics, as well as Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager integrations.

You can even leverage your listenership through audio advertising. Use our self-serve audio advertising feature to create your own campaigns or use VAST (video ad serving template) to connect a programmatic advertising platform, such as Google Ad Manager.

Release date: 30th October 2024

**Fixes**

* [#404](https://github.com/beyondwords-io/wordpress-plugin/pull/404) Bring auto-publish setting into WordPress to fix auto-publishing.
    * In some cases WordPress was publishing audio regardless of the auto-publish setting in the dashboard.
    * After this update any content created with the WordPress plugin will need to be published in the BeyondWords dashboard.
* [#407](https://github.com/beyondwords-io/wordpress-plugin/pull/407) Regenerate audio for all post statuses
    * If a post has a content ID for audio then we now *always* make PUT requests to the BeyondWords REST API when the post is updated.
    * This fixes an issue where the `published` property of audio was not set to `false` when WordPress posts were moved back to `draft` status.
* [#408](https://github.com/beyondwords-io/wordpress-plugin/pull/408) Generate Audio checkbox in Classic Editor doesn't reflect the "Preselect" setting
    * A change in the `v5.0` update meant the "Preselect generate audio" JS script was no longer being enqueued. This should now be fixed.

= 5.0.0 =

Release date: 15th October 2024

**Enhancements**

* [#385](https://github.com/beyondwords-io/wordpress-plugin/pull/385) Extend plugin settings using a tabbed interface.
    * The plugin settings screen has been expanded to include settings from the BeyondWords dashboard, allowing you to set various BeyondWords settings without leaving WordPress.
    * Changes made in WordPress will be immediately copied over to the BeyondWords dashboard when "Save settings" is pressed.
    * Changes made in the BeyondWords dashboard will be copied over to WordPress when you visit the relevant plugin settings tab.

**Breaking changes**

* Legacy audio player support has been removed.
    * The legacy BeyondWords player is no longer natively supported in the WordPress plugin. 
    * The standard [BeyondWords Player](https://docs.beyondwords.io/docs-and-guides/player/overview) is now the only built-in option for the audio player.
* Remove built-in Elementor compatibility.
    * Basic support for audio generation and auto-player embeds should still work for posts that are created with Elementor, although you will be unable to see a BeyondWords player in the Elementor post edit screens. To view our player in WordPress admin you can temporarily switch to the Block or Classic editors.
    * Refer to our [WordPress filters](https://docs.beyondwords.io/docs-and-guides/content/connect-cms/wordpress/wordpress-filters) docs and the [Elementor hooks](https://developers.elementor.com/docs/hooks/) docs if you wish to add Elementor support to your site.
* Stop saving the legacy `beyondwords_podcast_id` param. 
    * This change means that posts generated with versions `v5.0.0` and later will not play audio if the plugin is downgraded to `v3.x` or below. 
    * If you need to downgrade to `v3.x` after using `v5.x` please contact us for support.
* Remove deprecated filters. 
    * A number of deprecated filters have now been removed from the source code.
    * Refer to our [WordPress Filters](https://docs.beyondwords.io/docs-and-guides/content/connect-cms/wordpress/wordpress-filters) documentation to view the current filters we provide.
